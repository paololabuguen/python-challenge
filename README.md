# python-challenge

There are 2 parts to this project. The first one is PyBank, in which we write a python script to read the budget data csv file
then output the results of the total months, total net profit/loss, average change in profit/loss month after month, greatest increase
and the greatest decrease in profits in a separate text file.

The second part is PyPoll, which reads the election data csv file then outputs the total number of votes, a list of all the candidates,
the percentage of votes each candidate received and their total vote count, and the ultimate winner of the election.

I worked on this challenge by myself with some help from Excel to debug some of the code.
